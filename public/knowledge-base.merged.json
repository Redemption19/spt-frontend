    "content": "Compound interest is the magic behind long-term savings growth. It's the interest you earn not only on your initial principal but also on the accumulated interest from previous periods.\n\nExample: If you save GHS 100 and earn 10% interest, you'll have GHS 110 after one year. In the second year, you'll earn 10% on GHS 110, not just GHS 100, so you get GHS 11 more, making it GHS 121. This snowball effect makes early and consistent saving incredibly powerful for retirement planning.",

These contributions also enjoy tax benefits and are managed by licensed private pension fund managers.",

If your pension savings don't grow at a rate higher than inflation, your retirement income will be able to buy less in the future.\n\nImpact: A fixed pension amount might seem sufficient today, but its real value diminishes with inflation.\n\nMitigation: Pension Fund Managers invest your contributions in various assets (equities, bonds, real estate) to generate returns that ideally outpace inflation, preserving and growing the real value of your retirement savings. This is why having investments in your Tier 2 and Tier 3 schemes is vital, as they aim to generate real returns.",
